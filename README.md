## React Starter

> <b>:star2: React Starter Kit</b> is a boilerplate which helps you build fast and efficient web apps or sites. This is a good place to start your project, or any other project what you need to develop. The boilerplate is built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). For a development process the <b>Starter Kit</b> uses modern web development tools such as [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) and [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader). The boilerplate contains full stack modern modules and wonderful tools such as [redux-cli](https://github.com/SpencerCDixon/redux-cli) which can generate snippets of `components`, `containers`, `react-forms` and `tests`.
> <br/>:eyes: If you are not familiar with React and Redux you can analyse a demo application which is included in the <b style='color: orange;'>Starter Kit</b>.

## Structure

The folder structure provided is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. It is something that has worked very well for me and my team, but use only what makes sense to you.

```
